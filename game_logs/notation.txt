each letter represents a side of the hexagon.

the 7th letter represents the center of the hexagon. This is to determine if non-adjacent sides are connected.
the 8th number represents the amount of fields. (optional. only refers to field count)

examples:

------ -    : empty tile
g-g--- -    : two tree patches, not connected.
g-g--- g    : two tree patches, connected via the center.
yy---- - 1  : hexagon with two sides of fields, but with with a value of 1. One field count for the quest.
